# Event Navigator

## Overview
The **Event Navigator** is a full-stack web application that allows users to view. The front-end is built using React, and the back-end is powered by Express.js and MongoDB. The app retrieves event data from a MongoDB database and displays it in a list format, allowing users to view event details such as title, location, time, and a link to view the event on a map.

## Features
- View a list of events fetched from the server.
- Display event details including title, location, date and time, and a map link.
- Add new events to the database via a POST request (backend functionality implemented and connnecting it to the frontend is under working ).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Libraries**: Axios (for HTTP requests), Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), CORS (for cross-origin requests)
